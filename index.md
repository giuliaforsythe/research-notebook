# Why am I taking this course?
I haven't completed an open online course since my numerous times through [#ds106](http://ds106.us/ "the MOOC mothership"), and even then the "requirements" for completion were so loose, it's debatable I really have the dedication and commitment to see an open course through to the end.

It is with that introduction that I preface that I am very interested in taking #hist3907o because I like the idea of handling historical data, [making cool things](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/ "Northwestern makes cool things"), learning github and markdown, and hopefully some other tools: gephi or some sort of [open map application](http://www.openhistoricalmap.org/)?

There are so many rabbit holes to explore, it's taking exceptionally long to complete any particular task. That's what Saturday nights are for, right?

Additionally I should mention, I've been working with two very interesting historians at [BrockU](http://brocku.ca) as part of my work in educational development and online course design and have started working a bit with a third to work out some ways we can bring more digital humanities within our history department.

Finally, some of the most interesting people I follow on twitter consider themselves digital historians and I'd like to understand their world a bit better.
