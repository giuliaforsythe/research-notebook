# Big Data for Dead People notes

Notes from Tim Hitchock blog post http://historyonics.blogspot.ca/2013/12/big-data-for-dead-people-digital.html

Do format shifts of data also shift our thinking? How?

##Distant reading - text analysis

Dialogue analysis. Period representation e.g Mad Men vs contemporary literature, overstated language disconnect. e.g outside world (early); emotions (later) = "evolution of masculinity"  as a way of highlighting change. Normative analysis via Ngram & Google books.

(Ben Schmidt)

Our inquiry is bound by our technology; limiting the extent at which we can ask good questions.

Inclusion of other texts beyond "text" from other sources beyond the common patriarchal dominant writers

combine close & distant reading; 

Sarah Durrant - imprisonment photo & trial text, using xml to mark up "speech acts" cross referencing demographic data about Sarah, maps, census data, allowing a "new kind of close reading"

use Voyant tools to turn historical reading into a linguistic one; compare trial text to newspaper text. compare to contemporary google books brings fuller context; police & court, plea bargaining, difficult to navigate for poor and elderly

odd use of "vanilla sex" as an analogy for how heavily relied upon text is for context

use of the word "haptic" (sense of touch, manipulation of objects)  immersive simulation (cow birth) / 3d text / aural (John Donne's sermons in 1620s)

Katy Börner's notion of a Macroscope (large and small)

"conundrums of positivism" - technology is still defining the questions we ask

pushing towards social science

code as metaphor (plus lots of deep digging into geospatial google earth recreations of time and place through GIS that I am not fully grasping the aha importance of yet.

left my first hypothesis note (there are no other hypothesis notes here, why?) Is he saying something about inductive vs deductive methods? Where typically historians have a model or a hypothesis but now they are allowing the data to tell the story?

Letting your data tell a story is dangerous c.f. climate change and pirates

I wonder about the emergence of non-historical thinkers who like code who encroach on the discipline

seam as metaphor for construction between collection data and online representation
