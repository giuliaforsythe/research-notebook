*collapse of time and space (historically not new)
*using collections of metadata to search the web

*existential questions within Google search [black box search] or reinforce existing prejudices within our "cultural record"

*seam as metaphor for construction between collection data and online representation

*"they have been created by many acts of selection, neglect, vision, accident and planning"

*Check out [Trove] (http://trove.nla.gov.au/) with 5,273,600 (at time of writing Feb 15) now 6,523,415 has:corrections one year later

*dangers of the platform metaphor for trove

*need a better term than user for online collaborators/engagers in social platforms

*seams as speed bumps - sites of collaboration, negotiation and repair


#Theorizing Research Practices We Forgot to Theorize Twenty Years Ago

*scholarly evidences of search practices
*does it strengthen confirmation bias
*uses the word "hermeneutic" about a dozen times

*open-ended strategy, we can map the print record by allowing an algorithm to organize the language of a collection -clusters of terms that tend to occur in the same contexts. (known  as  ‘‘topic  modeling’’)  reveals  discursive patterns that the researcher didn’t necessarily go looking for.

*"Researchers can never afford to treat algorithms as black boxes that generate mysterious authority."
*be aware of assumptions

c.f. ‘‘Topic modeling’’ is a name for a large family of algorithms, but the algorithm most commonly used by humanists is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). For an accessible  humanistic  introduction,
see  Ted  Underwood,  ‘‘Topic  Modeling Made Just Simple Enough,’’
